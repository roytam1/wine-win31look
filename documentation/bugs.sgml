      <title>What to do if some program still doesn't work?</title>

      <para>
      There are times when you've been trying everything, you even killed a cat
      at full moon and ate it with rotten garlic and foul fish
      while doing the Devil's Dance, yet nothing helped to make some damn
      program work on some Wine version.
      Don't despair, we're here to help you...
      (in other words: how much do you want to pay ?)
      </para>

        <title>Verify your wine configuration</title>
        <para>

      <sect2>
        <title>Use different windows version settings</title>

	<para>
	In several cases using <link linkend="config-windows-versions">different windows version settings</link> can help.
        </para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Use different startup paths</title>

	<para>
	  This sometimes helps, too:

	  Try to use both
	  <command>wine prg.exe</command>
	  and
	  <command>wine x:\\full\\path\\to\\prg.exe</command>
	</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Fiddle with DLL configuration</title>

	<para>
	  Run with --debugmsg +loaddll to figure out which DLLs are
	  being used, and whether they're being loaded as native or
	  built-in.
	  Then make sure you have proper native DLL files in your
	  configured C:\windows\system directory and fiddle with DLL
	  load order settings at command line or in config file.
	</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Check your system environment !</title>

	<para>
	  Just an idea: could it be that your Wine build/execution
	  environment is broken ?

	  Make sure that there are no problems whatsoever with the
	  packages
	  that Wine depends on (gcc, glibc, X libraries, OpenGL (!), ...)

	  E.g. some people have strange failures to find stuff when
	  using "wrong" header files for the "right" libraries !!!
	  (which results in days of debugging to desperately try to find
	  out why that lowlevel function fails in a way that is completely
	  beyond imagination... ARGH !)
	</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Use different GUI (Window Manager) modes</title>
	
	<para>
	  Instruct Wine via config file to use either desktop mode,
	  managed mode or plain ugly "normal" mode.
	  That can make one hell of a difference, too.
	</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Check your app !</title>
	
	<para>
	  Maybe your app is using some kind of copy protection ?

	  Many copy protections currently don't work on Wine.
	  Some might work in the future, though.
	  (the CD-ROM layer isn't really full-featured yet).
	</para>

	<para>
	  Go to <ulink
	  url="http://www.gamecopyworld.com">GameCopyWorld</ulink>
	  and try to find a decent crack for your game that gets rid of
	  that ugly copy protection.
	  I hope you do have a legal copy of the program, though... :-)
	</para>

      <sect2>
        <title>Check your Wine environment !</title>
        
	<para>
	  Running with or without a Windows partition can have a
	  dramatic impact.

	  Configure Wine to do the opposite of what you used to have.

	  Also, install DCOM98 or DCOM95. This can be very beneficial.
	</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Reconfigure Wine</title>
	
	<para>
	  Sometimes wine installation process changes and new versions of
	  Wine account on these changes.
	  This is especially true if your setup was created long time ago.

	  Rename your existing <filename>~/.wine</filename> directory
	  for backup purposes.
	  Use the setup process that's recommended for your Wine distribution
	  to create new configuration.
	  Use information in old <filename>~/.wine</filename>
	  directory as a reference.
	  For source wine distribution to configure Wine run
	  tools/wineinstall script as a user you want to do the configuration
	  for.
	  This is a pretty safe operation. Later you can remove the new
	  <filename>~/.wine</filename> directory and rename your old one back.

        <title>Crashes</title>
        <para>
           If Wine crashes while running your program, it is
           important that we have this information to have a chance
           at figuring out what is causing the crash.  This can put
           out quite a lot (several MB) of information, though, so
           it's best to output it to a file.  When the <prompt>Wine-dbg></prompt>
           prompt appears, type <userinput>quit</userinput>.
        </para>
        <para>
           You might want to try
           <parameter>+relay,+snoop</parameter> instead of
           <parameter>+relay</parameter>, but please note that
           <parameter>+snoop</parameter> is pretty unstable and
           often will crash earlier than a simple
           <parameter>+relay</parameter>! If this is the case, then
           please use <emphasis>only</emphasis> <parameter>+relay</parameter>!!
           A bug report with a crash in <parameter>+snoop</parameter>
           code is useless in most cases!
           You can also turn on other parameters, depending on the nature
           of the problem you are researching. See wine man page for full list
           of the parameters.

               run <command>which perl</command>. If it returns something like
               <filename>/usr/bin/perl</filename>, you're in business.
               Otherwise, skip on down to "The Hard Way". If you aren't
               sure, just keep on going. When you try to run the
               script, it will become <emphasis>very</emphasis> apparent

        For one reason or another you may find yourself with a Linux
        library that you want to use as if it were a Windows Dll.  There are
        various reasons for this including the following:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              You are porting a large application that uses several third-party
              libraries.  One is available on Linux but you are not yet ready
              to link to it directly as a Linux shared library.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              There is a well-defined interface available and there are several 
	      Linux solutions that are available for it
	      (e.g. the ODBC interface in Wine).
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
	      You have a binary only Windows application that can be extended 
	      through plugins, such as a text editor or IDE.
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
        The process for dealing with these situations is actually quite simple.
        You need to write a spec file that will describe the library's 
        interface in the same format as a Dll (primarily what functions it
        exports).  Also you will want to write a small wrapper around the
        library.  You combine these to form a Wine built-in Dll that links to the
        Linux library.  Then you modify the DllOverrides in the wine config
        file to ensure that this new built-in DLL is called rather than any
        windows version.
      </para>
      <para>
        In this section we will look at two examples.  The first example is
        extremely simple and leads into the subject in "baby steps".  The
        second example is the ODBC interface proxy in Wine.  The files to which
        we will refer for the ODBC example are currently in the 
        <filename class="Directory">dlls/odbc32</filename> directory of the
        Wine source.
      </para>
      <para>
         The first example is based very closely on a real case (the names
         of the functions etc. have been changed to protect the innocent).
         A large Windows application includes a DLL that links to a third-party
         DLL.  For various reasons the third-party DLL does not work too well
         under Wine.  However the third-party library is also available for the
         Linux environment.  Conveniently the DLL and Linux shared library 
         export only a small number of functions and the application only uses
         one of those.
       </para>
       <para>
         Specifically, the application calls a function:
<programlisting>
signed short WINAPI MyWinFunc (unsigned short a, void *b, void *c,
        unsigned long *d, void *e, int f, char g, unsigned char *h);
</programlisting>
         and the linux library exports a corresponding function:
<programlisting>
signed short MyLinuxFunc (unsigned short a, void *b, void *c,
        unsigned short *d, void *e, char g, unsigned char *h);
</programlisting>
       </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="bindlls-spec">
      <title id="bindlls-spec.title">Writing the spec file</title>
      <para>
        Start by writing the spec file.  This file will describe the interface
        as if it were a DLL.  See elsewhere for the details of the format of
        a spec file (e.g. man winebuild).
      </para>
      <para>
        In the simple example we want a Wine built-in Dll that corresponds to
        the MyWin Dll.  The spec file is <filename>MyWin.dll.spec</filename> and
        looks something like this:
<programlisting>
#
# File: MyWin.dll.spec
#
# some sort of copyright
#
# Wine spec file for the MyWin.dll built-in library (a minimal wrapper around the
# linux library libMyLinux)
#
# For further details of wine spec files see the Winelib documentation at
# www.winehq.org

2 stdcall MyWinFunc (long ptr ptr ptr ptr long long ptr) MyProxyWinFunc

# End of file
</programlisting>
        Notice that the arguments are flagged as long even though they are
        smaller than that.  With this example we will link directly to the 
	Linux shared library whereas with the ODBC example we will load the 
	Linux shared library dynamically.
      </para>
      <para>
        In the case of the ODBC example you can see this in the file 
        <filename>odbc32.spec</filename>.
      </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="bindlls-wrapper">
      <title id="bindlls-wrapper.title">Writing the wrapper</title>
      <para>
        Firstly we will look at the simple example.  The main complication of
        this case is the slightly different argument lists.  The f parameter
        does not have to be passed to the Linux function and the d parameter
        (theoretically) has to be converted between 
	<literal>unsigned long *i</literal> and <literal>unsigned short *</literal>.  
	Doing this ensures that the "high" bits of the returned value are set 
	correctly.  Also unlike with the ODBC example we will link directly to
	the Linux Shared Library.

      <para>
        For a more extensive case we can use the ODBC example.  This is
        implemented as a header file 
        (<filename class="HeaderFile">proxyodbc.h</filename>) and the actual
        C source file (<filename>proxyodbc.c</filename>).  Although the file
        is quite long it is extremely simple in structure.
      </para>
      <para>
        <function>DllMain</function> the function is used to initialize the DLL.
        On the process attach event the function dynamically links to the
        desired Linux ODBC library (since there are several available) and
        builds a list of function pointers.  It unlinks on the process
        detach event.
      </para>
      <para>
        Then each of the functions simply calls the appropriate Linux function
        through the function pointer that was set up during initialization.

        So how do we actually build the Wine built-in Dll?  The easiest way is
        to get Winemaker to do the hard work for us.  For the simple example we
        have two source files (the wrapper and the spec file).  We also have
        the 3rd party header and library files of course.
      </para>
      <para>
        Put the two source files in a suitable directory and then use 
        winemaker to create the build framework, including configure script,
        makefile etc.  You will want to use the following options of 
        winemaker:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              --nosource-fix and --nogenerate-specs (requires winemaker version
              0.5.8 or later) to ensure that the two files are not modified.
              (If using an older version of winemaker then make the two files
              readonly and ignore the complaints about being unable to modify
              them).
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              --dll --single-target MyWin --nomfc to specify the target
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              -DMightNeedSomething -I3rd_party_include -L3rd_party_lib -lxxxx
              -lyyyy where these are the locations of the header files etc.
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
        After running winemaker I like to edit the Makefile.in to add the line
        CEXTRA = -Wall just before the DEFINES =.
      </para>
      <para>
        Then simply run the configure and make as normal (described elsewhere).
      </para>

        So how do you install the proxy and ensure that everything connects up
        correctly?  You have quite a bit of flexibility in this area so what 
        follows are not the only options available.
      </para>
      <para>
        Ensure that the actual Linux Shared Object is placed somewhere where
        the Linux system will be able to find it.  Typically this means it 
        should be in one of the directories mentioned in the /etc/ld.so.conf
        file or somewhere in the path specified by LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  If you 
        can link to it from a Linux program it should be OK.
      </para>
      <para>
        Put the proxy shared object (MyWin.dll.so) in the same place as the
        rest of the built-in DLLs.  (If you used winemaker to set up your build
        environment then running "make install" as root should do that for you)
        Alternatively ensure that WINEDLLPATH includes the directory containing
        the proxy shared object.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you have both a Windows DLL and a Linux DLL/proxy pair then you will
        have to ensure that the correct one gets called.  The easiest way is
        probably simply to rename the windows version so that it doesn't get
        detected.  Alternatively you could specify in the DllOverrides section
        (or the AppDefaults\\myprog.exe\\DllOverrides section) of the config
        file (in your .wine directory) that the built-in version be used.  Note
        that if the Windows version Dll is present and is in the same
        directory as the executable (as opposed to being in the Windows
        directory) then you will currently need to specify the whole path to
        the dll, not merely its name.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once you have done this you should be using the Linux Shared Object
        successfully.  If you have problems then use the --debugmsg +module
        options to wine to see what is actually happening.

        Suppose you want to convert incoming DOS format filenames to their
        Unix equivalent.  Of course there is no suitable function in the true
        Microsoft Windows API, but wine provides a function for just this
        task and exports it from its copy of the kernel32 DLL.  The function
        is <function>wine_get_unix_file_name</function> (defined in winbase.h).

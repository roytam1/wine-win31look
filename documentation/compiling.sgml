    <para>
      In case you downloaded Wine source code files, this chapter will
      tell you how to compile it into binary files before installing them.
      Otherwise, please proceed directly to the <link
      linkend="installing">Installation chapter</link> to install the
      binary Wine files.

        <title>Requirements</title>
	<para>
	  For an up-to-date list of software requirements for compiling
	  Wine and instructions how to actually do it, please see the <ulink
	  url="http://www.winehq.org/source/README">README</ulink> file,
	  which is also available in the main directory of a Wine source
	  code tree.

        <title>Space required</title>
	<para>
	  You also need about 400 MB of available disk space for compilation.
	  The compiled libwine.so binary takes around 5 MB of disk space,
	  which can be reduced to about 1 MB by stripping ('strip wine').
	  Stripping is not recommended, however, as you can't submit
	  proper crash reports with a stripped binary.

        <title>Common problems</title>
	<para>
	  If you get a repeatable sig11 compiling shellord.c, thunk.c
	  or other files, try compiling just that file without optimization
	  (removing the -Ox option from the GCC command in the
	  corresponding Makefile).

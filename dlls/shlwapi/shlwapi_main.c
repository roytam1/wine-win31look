 * Internet Explorer was 'integrated' into the O/S with the release of Win98.

 * All functions exported by ordinal are undocumented by MS. The vast majority
 * of these are wrappers for Unicode functions that may not exist on early 16
 * bit platforms. The remainder perform various small tasks and presumably were
 * added to facilitate code reuse amongst the MS developers.
